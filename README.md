## About The Project

Embark on a journey to launch your own Telegram bot with ease. WinNFTbot is designed to facilitate seamless communication with an interested audience, enabling participation in NFT raffles and offering a referral program.

## Built With

Crafted using procedural PHP version 7+, this project eschews libraries for simplicity and universality, ensuring compatibility with any PHP and MySQL supporting hosting. This approach also simplifies code editing.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Hosting supporting PHP 7 and MySQL.

### Installation 

#### Main Executable Script
The core of the bot is the `tgbot.php` script, serving as the main executable.

#### Step 1: Configuring `config.php`
First, tailor the `config.php` file to your specific settings: 

```php
############################
$admin = 00000; // ChatID of the bot's manager or owner
$NFTwallet = "XXXXX"; // TON Wallet for receiving payments
$WinNFTbotRefPercent = 10; // Percentage for the referral program
$XAPIKey = ""; // API Key for Toncenter website
$CryptoPayAPIToken = ""; // CryptoPay API Token
define('TOKEN', 'XXXXX'); // Your Bot's API Token
########### TEGRO DATA ################
$user_id = 0000; // User ID for Tegro Money
$api_key = 'XXX'; // API Key for Tegro Money
$roskassa_publickey = 'XXXX'; // Public Key for Tegro Money
$roskassa_secretkey = 'XXXX'; // Secret Key for Tegro Money
############################
```

#### Step 2: Registering Bot with Cryptopay
Register your bot in Cryptopay by specifying the postback URL for seamless transaction processing.
Postback URL for Cryptopay: [https://yourdomain/BotFolder/postback_cryptopay.php](https://yourdomain/BotFolder/postback_cryptopay.php)

#### Step 3: Configuring Tegro Money Postback URL
Set up the postback URL in your Tegro Money account to handle payments efficiently.
Tegro Money Postback URL: [https://yourdomain/BotFolder/postback.php](https://yourdomain/BotFolder/postback.php)

#### Step 4: MySQL Database Configuration
Fill in your MySQL database details in the `global.php` file to ensure proper data management and storage.

#### Step 5: Importing MySQL Database Structure
Use the `database.sql` file to import the necessary database structure. This step is vital for setting up the bot's database schema.

#### Step 6: Installing the Webhook
Set up the webhook for your bot on the Telegram API. This step is crucial for enabling real-time communication between your bot and Telegram.
Webhook Installation URL: [https://api.telegram.org/botXXXXX/setWebhook?url=https://yourdomain/BotFolder/tgbot.php](https://api.telegram.org/botXXXXX/setWebhook?url=https://yourdomain/BotFolder/tgbot.php)

#### Step 7: Customizing Bot Texts
Edit the `lang.php` file to customize your bot's responses and texts. This allows for a personalized user experience.
